# Video 02 – JUnit Assertions

This folder contains the source code for **Video 02** in the  
YouTube Spring Testing Module.

## 🎯 Objective

Understand how JUnit determines whether a test **passes or fails**  
using different types of **Assertions**.

## 📚 Topics Covered

- What is an Assertion in unit testing
- Common JUnit assertions:
  - `assertEquals`
  - `assertTrue` / `assertFalse`
  - `assertNull` / `assertNotNull`
  - `assertThrows`
  - `assertAll`
  - `assertTimeout`
- Verifying exception messages
- Best practices when choosing assertions

## 🧩 Example Used

A simple **Calculator** class is used to demonstrate:

- Mathematical operations testing  
- Boolean checks  
- Exception validation

A simple **StudentService** class is used to demonstrate:

- Null handling  
- Grouped assertions with `assertAll`  
- Performance check with `assertTimeout`

The goal is to keep the logic **simple** so the focus stays on  
**understanding assertions**, not business complexity.
